## Neighbors at close proximity

**Can we make it happen?**

We are a team of 4 designers and 4 developers.

What can we (as a group) get done. We had 3 days. Here, I take my chance
to ask any questions and put them in a form of a persona, our collective
representation of who the user is.

**Devices** Our persona we were building, Sabrina, was busy. What sort of
busy though? One scenario, early at the brainstorm assumptions stage,
was that at a key moment we would find Sabrina at a compact, busy place
with kids in tow: the grocery store. Here, it makes sense that she would
likey be pulling out a phone rather than a laptop at a grocery store.
Two choices allow us to work with that.

-   Webapp Our work can work for iOS devices, but up to a point. We
    focused on browser based interactions.

-   Mobile If we are putting together visuals in a short amount of time,
    it makes sense that would borrow from a design library. While we did
    not go with iOS, we knew our first stab at this design would be on the
    phone. This decision boxed us in a bit, but with the important benefit
    of allowing us to move forward on the design quickly.
    
    **\* Research
    \*\*** Other task apps

Much work has been done for us already if we only look and see what is
out there. To keep us from doing repetitive work, looked at commonly
used (but established) features that we would use as pieces of our
puzzle in building the initial prototypes.

**Common traits** The commonality is an IRL system of gathering groceries
in our case.

-   **Task Rabbit**
-   **Amazon (Wholefoods)**
-   **Instacart**

Our analysis required we break the information down into simliar
components

-   Cart
-   Schedule
-   Sort

emblematic of ‘in what space' we were trying to accomplish our design

### Zeroing in on trust

**Themes that include trust**

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_939A39C54BE532AA128503EB46A60918FB25F0AE543B578BF78BB58E8F771B97_1626047441287_2021-07-11+18.47.58.gif)

### Looking at the Task Business

As the dev team went to design an inital user model in the code, the UX
Team went to take a mental snapshot of where mental boundaries may help
guide our priorities. We might need to express them at design handoff.  
**Business Analysis** While it may be fun to have a ‘karma'-like
affordance to energize task uptake&#x2026;we do find some priorities:

-   Cart
-   Date
-   Items
-   Sort

**Learn Quick** Our user, we imagine, is a real person with limited time.
Who does she pay back first.

**Closeness of Volunteers and Trust Themes**

A level of trust is required

Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative
persona felt that way, The seams are still closing in on their way to
delivering it to four groups of 10 people.


<a id="org89e755b"></a>

### But how do you know?

**Persona**

Sabrina happens to be busy, especially with tasks required to raise two
children.

To maintain growing trust, neighbors in the persona's proximity see
opportunities to help and add them to their queue.


<a id="orgf5c4731"></a>

## Thin air trust

Sabrina needs help. She needs to ask for a favor. The gudeeds app needs
more uptake to be successful. It is my role to ask if something is
possible from the dev team. Don' t we need a network in place to gain
trust? Is that something that can be coded?

The persona add neighbors and they in-turn help her down the line.
Without an initial network, how would confidence translate to favor
completions? The dev team seemed to ponder out input closely.


<a id="org2c43e08"></a>

### On the Problem

**Just the stress of asking is enough of a barrier to moving forward.**


<a id="org7313090"></a>

### For the Solution

**Less Stressed**

Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve
or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems
appropriate.

while maybe still busy, she is less stressed out.

## Design work


<a id="orgea29b0b"></a>

### Sketching

-   [design Studio Brackets]

**Designing for the Time Crunch** A situation recognized as a
'time-crunch.'


<a id="orgc93ee22"></a>

### Two canvases

There is the volunteer who participates by completing grocery pickup,
and other tasks for neighbor. Do we build first for the volunteer, or
the neighbor?

**Discussing them separately**

Are we talking about the same screen? The actual meeting we had on this
was short but valuable. The design and engineering agreed that everyone
would start at the same page one.

We are trying to make sure that an extremely busy person is not spending
more time learning how to use our app at the end the week. Sabrina, for
example, may have the app in hand to possibly do the opposite, and take
on more tasks than usual. We now had our one-pager - a few screens laid
out in succession. This is when we put that much to the test.

### Clear feedback

We easily save time by acting on the right feedback, and make good bets
on where they are taking us by acting on their clues

**Our initial perception** She prepares for her upcoming week with the
help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

**Our perception of obvious placement of a primary button, was
actuallly:**

-   Confusing
-   Redundant

**Categories** Clarifying types of tasks that others get help with, she is
likely to book also.

## Right now


<a id="orgbe6ec60"></a>

### Gudeeds as client

To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation implies that
their app is better at being reliable.


<a id="org1f4f491"></a>

### Next Steps

**Explore if gamification is a good fit.**

Sandra is busy and just downloaded the Gudeeds app. The app will help
build trust across her neighbors ' relationships.

If booking now is based on trust, will charts and mini-analyticst be
more efficient to confirming her bookings?
