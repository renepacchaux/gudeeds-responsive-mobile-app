## Responsive Mobile App

### Kind of an overview

Our persona, Sandra was representative of a situation recognized as a 'time-crunch.' She saw and recognized neighborly deeds as tasks that she figures are better to pay back.  Our UX Team serves this aim by being part of the get-it-done process.  A level of trust is required. Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative persona felt that way, continues into my role as presenter.  The seams are still closing in on their way to delivering it to four groups of 10 people.

Keep your wits on a time-crunch.
