## Neighborly recognition


<a id="orgcd3e60f"></a>

### Preparing to solve a problem

I was part of a team of 4 designers and 5 developers. I communicated the
design process to show progress when meeting with engineers. I described
my pre-conceptions when meeting with the other designers. Since I was
meeting with the design team, more often our work included touch points
on what the next task was. In effect, we were practicing our meetings
with developers. Those meetings had to be short and decisive.

**Devices in mind**

I am going to describe my initial thoughts. At this initial stage, I
need to describe a thing that already works. For an example scenario, I
picture myself at a grocery store and I am carrying a laptop. Who pulls
out a laptop at the grocery store? I am likely to instead use my phone.
Before any pencil has hit paper, I have made a mental decision about
where this application will life. When I talk to the design team, I
might mention apps being built out for multiple screens. To help move
this piece forward, I can set one screen as a goal: the mobile version.
The mobile-sized screen is my chosen screen to build upon. This would
put anything other than phone-sized screens further down the priority
ladder. I reap the benefit of not overlapping my effort with anyone
elses. I need to know everyone elses direction but not plans. I can
listen to issues about the buildout along the way. I wanted to commit to
the next meeting being a smooth one.

I call out a few details about the choices and what doors they might
open for future continued updates.

-   Desktop Web Application
    
    I can get a lot out of browsers. This situations where a user will
    open a laptop or be at a desktop are already defined to me, in a
    sense.

-   Mobile
    
    I know there is less room for features. Where a user looks first takes
    a smaller footprint.

We put together visuals in a short amount of time. It makes sense. We
would borrow from a design library. We expanded our minds beyond
designing for iOS products. We knew our first stab at this design would
be on a phone width. The decision to use [Figma's Material Design UI
kit] (<https://www.figma.com/community/file/880534892514982400>) boxed us
in minimally. It gave us time, however, to benefit us moving forward on
designing.

## Research

Much work has been done for us already if we only look and see what is
out there. To keep us from doing repetitive work, we looked at commonly
used (but widely established) features that we would use as pieces of
our puzzle in building the initial prototypes.

**Common traits**

We search for well-defined places on the internet where people go. What
is already available to perform similar services? In these target roles,
there is at least someone picking up groceries for somebody else.

-   Task Rabbit
-   Amazon (Wholefoods)
-   Instacart

We break the information down into digestible parts. This gave us an
opportunity to pick up more on the best practices side of things over
mere features.

-   Cart
-   Schedule
-   Sort

As we moved towards defining user needs, the direction we took involved
more and more interviewees, testers, co-workers, and yes, actual
neighbors.

### Zeroing in on trust

**Themes that include trust**

### Looking at the Task Business

The cross-functional team went to build all the parts that make up a
virtual person within an app. They are a person has age and location, as
task giver or receiver. In the inner workings of Gudeeds, the UX Team
contributed the moment in time, as seen by the user, that qualifies as
the point of entry as a person who needs a thing. As a UX practitioner,
I am concerned about efficiency and where time spent simply learning to
use the app guides our priorities. We were building a context to hand
off and accurately express the blueprints to the development team.

**Business Analysis** It would be fun to have a ‘karma'-like score. Maybe
for the backend - a dashboard, maybe. We set this aside because our
testing gave us an already clear direction and a trending-contribution
did not make it past the design studio stage.

At judgment time, we were asked that a positive approach to ‘more'
hierarchy will be beneficial to the app. I come back to this at the
section on gamification.

There are symbols or items people expect and go to first. These allow
the user to work fast:

-   Cart
-   Date
-   Items
-   Sort

**Learn Quick**

Our user, we imagine, is a real person with limited time. Who does she
pay back first?

**Closeness of Volunteers and Trust Themes**

**First to sign up**

Our team starts to figure out and document why a person in Sabrina's
shoes would have felt the way she did.

We thought about how we would deliver our work at the final meta
meeting. We are on our way to delivering it to four groups of 10 people.


<a id="org29e5ae9"></a>

### But how do you know?

Our persona was built on a few back-and-forths we had about our mindset.

We had three days. Here, I take my chance to ask any questions about our
made-up person, Sabrina. We all know a Sabrina. She has kids and little
time. Our Sabrina happens to be a nurse with odd hours.

**Sabrina**

To maintain a growing connection to the people around her and in her
building, neighbors need opportunities to help. We went on the simplify
this.

Sabrina also works to raise two children.


<a id="orgf9979c2"></a>

### Trust Summary

Sabrina needs help. She needs to ask for a favor. The gudeeds app needs
more uptake to be successful. It is my role to ask if something is
possible from the dev team. Don't we need a network in place to gain
trust? Is that something that can be coded?

The persona adds neighbors. They, in turn, help *her* down the line.
Without an initial network, what would lead Sabrina to believe that this
app can be of any help when she downloads it? Do we make it fun like a
game, or do we consider putting it in the ‘maybe pile' for now? The team
of engineers seemed to appreciate this problem being voiced at our
meeting.


<a id="orgcd244f5"></a>

### On the Problem

We discovered what we needed and visualized it. Let's set up our
guardrails voiced in the manner of something we are trying to solve.

**Just the stress of asking is enough of a barrier to moving forward.**

Frustrating, but expected. That is what we are banking on. A solid
direction for the app. The difference between *saying it* and *doing
it*.


<a id="org66773fc"></a>

### For the Solution

**Less Stressed**

Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve
or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems
appropriate.

While she may be busy, we can estimate that at this particular moment,
she is less stressed out.

## Design


<a id="org128d04e"></a>

### Sketching

-   [design Studio Brackets]

**Designing for the Time Crunch**

A situation recognized as a 'time-crunch.'


<a id="org104068b"></a>

### Two canvases

There is the volunteer who participates by completing grocery pickup and
other tasks for the neighbors. Do we build first for the volunteer or
the neighbor?

**Discussing them separately**

Are we talking about the same screen? The actual meeting we had on this
was short but valuable. The design and engineering agreed that everyone
would start on the same page.

We are trying to make sure that an extremely busy person is not
inundated with learning how to use our app at the end of the week.
Sabrina, for example, may have the app in hand to possibly do the
opposite and take on more tasks than usual. We now had our one-pager - a
few screens laid out in succession. This is when we put that much to the
test.

**Moving slightly into color**

**Getting answers with the help of two actual people**


<a id="orgda8f15b"></a>

### Clear feedback

We easily save time by acting on good feedback and making good bets.
They lead us when acting on their clues.

**Our initial perception** She prepares for her upcoming week with the
help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

**Primary action button perception**

-   Confusing
-   Redundant

**Categories** Clarifying types of tasks that others get help with, she is
likely to book also.


<a id="org2b73c44"></a>

### Case for moving forward #next


<a id="org6a17712"></a>

### Gudeeds as client

To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation implies that
their app is better at being reliable.


<a id="org3a2d372"></a>

### Next Steps

**Explore if gamification is a good fit.**

Sandra just downloaded the Gudeeds app. The app will help build trust
across her neighbors ' relationships.

If booking now is based on trust, will charts and mini-analytics be more
efficient to confirming her bookings?
