## Comfortable for some

**Can we make it happen?**

We are a team of designers and developers.

We had three days. Here, I take my chance to ask any questions about our
made-up person, Sabrina. We all know a Sabrina. She has kids and little
time. Our Sabrina happens to be a nurse with odd hours.

**Devices**

Our persona was built on a few back-and-forths we had about our mindset.
Where were we all coming from before we even list and describe any
assumptions on the table? At this stage, it makes sense that we mention
a scenario. A possible situation would be pulling out a phone rather
than a laptop at a grocery store. Technically speaking, two foundational
choices allow us to work with that.

-   Webapp
    
    Our work can work for iOS devices, but up to a point. We focused on
    where our user looks first when they get to our page. We open the door
    to future versions that can be opened from a browser on a desktop.

-   Mobile
    
    We put together visuals in a short amount of time. It makes sense. We
    would borrow from a design library. We expanded our minds beyond
    designing for iOS products. We knew our first stab at this design
    would be on a phone width. The decision to use [Figma's Material
    Design UI kit]
    (<https://www.figma.com/community/file/880534892514982400>) boxed us in
    minimally. It gave us time, however, to benefit us moving forward on
    designing.
    
    **\* Research
    \*\*** Other task apps

Much work has been done for us already if we only look and see what is
out there. To keep us from doing repetitive work, we looked at commonly
used (but widely established) features that we would use as pieces of
our puzzle in building the initial prototypes.

**Common traits** We search for well-defined places on the internet where
people go. What is already available to perform similar services? In
these target roles, there is at least someone picking up groceries for
somebody else.

-   Task Rabbit
-   Amazon (Wholefoods)
-   Instacart

We break the information down into digestable parts. This gave us an
opportunity to pick up more on the best practices side of things over
mere features.

-   Cart
-   Schedule
-   Sort

As we moved towards defining user needs, the direction we took involved
more and more interviewees, testers, co-workers, and yes, actual
neighbors.

### Zeroing in on trust

**Themes that include trust**

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_939A39C54BE532AA128503EB46A60918FB25F0AE543B578BF78BB58E8F771B97_1626047441287_2021-07-11+18.47.58.gif)

### Looking at the Task Business

As the cross-functional team went to build all the parts that make up a
virtual person within an app. They are a person with an age and
location, as task giver or receiver. In the inner workings of Gudeeds,
the UX Team contributed the moment in time, as seen by the user, that
qualifies as the point of entry as a person who needs a thing. As a UX
practitioner, I am concerned about efficiency and where time spent
simply learning to use the app guides our priorities. We were building a
context with which to hand off though accurately expressing the
blueprints to the development team.

**Business Analysis** It would be fun to have a ‘karma'-like score. Maybe
for the backend - a dashboard, maybe. We set this aside because our
testing gave us an already clear direction and a trending-contribution
did not make it past the design studio stage.

At judgment time, we were asked that a positive approach to ‘more'
hierarchy will be beneficial to the app. I come back to this at the
section on gamification.

There are symbols or items people go to first, or expect. These allow
the user to work fast:

-   Cart
-   Date
-   Items
-   Sort

**Learn Quick** Our user, we imagine, is a real person with limited time.
Who does she pay back first?

**Closeness of Volunteers and Trust Themes**

**First to sign up**

Our team, starts to figure out and document why a person in Sabrina's
shoes would have felt the way she did.

We thought about how we would deliver our work at the final meta
meeting. We are on our way to delivering it to four groups of 10 people.

### But how do you know?

**Sabrina**

To maintain a growing connection to the people around her and in her
building, neighbors need opportunities to help. We went on the simplify
this.

Sabrina also works to raise two children.


<a id="org0d6edf3"></a>

## Thin air trust

Sabrina needs help. She needs to ask for a favor. The gudeeds app needs
more uptake to be successful. It is my role to ask if something is
possible from the dev team. Don't we need a network in place to gain
trust? Is that something that can be coded?

The persona adds neighbors. They, in turn, help *her* down the line.
Without an initial network, what would lead Sabrina to believe that this
app can be of any help at the time she downloads it? Do we make it fun
like a game, or do we consider putting it in the ‘maybe pile' for now?
The team of engineers seemed to appreciate this problem being voiced at
our meeting.


<a id="org245c053"></a>

### On the Problem

We discovered what we needed and visualized it. Let's set up our
guardrails voiced in the manner of something we are trying to solve.

**Just the stress of asking is enough of a barrier to moving forward.**

Frustrating, but expected. That is what we are banking on. A solid
direction for the app. The difference between *saying it* and *doing
it*.


<a id="org74aac58"></a>

### For the Solution

**Less Stressed**

Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve
or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems
appropriate.

While she may be busy, we can estimate that in this particular moment,
she is less stressed out.

## Worthy of display

### Sketching

-   [design Studio Brackets]

**Designing for the Time Crunch** A situation recognized as a
'time-crunch.'


<a id="orgedfd3b1"></a>

### Two canvases

There is the volunteer who participates by completing grocery pickup and
other tasks for the neighbors. Do we build first for the volunteer or
the neighbor?

**Discussing them separately**

Are we talking about the same screen? The actual meeting we had on this
was short but valuable. The design and engineering agreed that everyone
would start at the same page.

We are trying to make sure that an extremely busy person is not spending
more time learning how to use our app at the end of the week. Sabrina,
for example, may have the app in hand to possibly do the opposite and
take on more tasks than usual. We now had our one-pager - a few screens
laid out in succession. This is when we put that much to the test.

**Moving slightly into color**

**Getting answers with the help of two actual people**


<a id="org56d7304"></a>

### Clear feedback

We easily save time by acting on the right feedback and making good
bets. They lead us when acting on their clues.

**Our initial perception** She prepares for her upcoming week with the
help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

**Primary action button perception**

-   Confusing
-   Redundant

**Categories** Clarifying types of tasks that others get help with, she is
likely to book also.


<a id="orgc3f35e5"></a>

## Case for moving forward


<a id="orgbf9319e"></a>

### Gudeeds as client

To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation implies that
their app is better at being reliable.


<a id="orgd435559"></a>

### Next Steps

**Explore if gamification is a good fit.**

Sandra just downloaded the Gudeeds app. The app will help build trust
across her neighbors ' relationships.

If booking now is based on trust, will charts and mini-analytics be more
efficient to confirming her bookings?
