**Closeness of Volunteers and Trust Themes**

A level of trust is required

Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative persona felt that way,The seams are still closing in on their way to delivering it to four groups of 10 people.

----------
## But how do you know?

**Persona**

----------

Sabrina happens to be busy, especially with tasks required to raise two children.  

----------

To maintain growing trust,  neighbors in the persona's proximity see opportunities to help and add them to their queue.  

----------
# Syncing Up
----------
## On the Problem
----------

**Just the stress of asking is enough of a barrier to moving forward.**

----------


## For the Solution

**Less Stressed**

----------

Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems appropriate. 

----------

while maybe still busy, she is less stressed out.

At the end of her weeks, she sees your life caseload with two children diminish while continueing to schedule more help and address her upcoming week.  

----------

**moving up fi, finding user A, user B.**


----------
## What testing taught us
----------

**Our initial perception**
She prepares for her upcoming week with the help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

----------

**Our perception of obvious placement of a primary button, was actuallly:**

- Confusing
- Redundant

**Categories**
Clarifying types of tasks that others get help with, she is likely to book also.

----------
# Current Day Status


## Gudeeds as client
----------

To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation implies that their app is better at being reliable.  

----------
## Next Steps
----------

**Explore if gamification is a good fit.**

----------

Sandra is busy and just downloaded the Gudeeds app.  The app will help build trust across her neighbors ' relationships. 

If booking now is based on trust,  will charts and mini-analyticst be more efficient to confirming her bookings?
