## Responsive Mobile App

### Kind of an overview

Our persona, Sandra was representative of a situation recognized as a 'time-crunch.' She saw and recognized neighborly deeds as tasks that she figures are better to pay back.  Our UX Team serves this aim by being part of the get-it-done process.  A level of trust is required. Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative persona felt that way, continues into my role as presenter.  The seams are still closing in on their way to delivering it to four groups of 10 people.

To maintain growing trust,  neighbors in the persona's proximity see opportunites to help and add them to their queue.  Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, can approve or deny based off her original request, focusing on nieghbors she deems appropriate.  She prepares her upcoming week with the help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.
