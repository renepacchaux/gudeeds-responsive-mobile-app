## Neighbors at close proximity

**Can we make it happen?**

We are a team of designers and developers.

We had three days. Here, I take my chance to ask any questions and put
them in the form of a persona, our collective representation of who the
user is.

**Devices** Our persona we were building, early at the brainstorm
assumptions stage. Here, it makes sense that she would likey be pulling
out a phone rather than a laptop at a grocery store. Two choices allow
us to work with that.

-   Webapp Our work can work for iOS devices, but up to a point. We
    focused on browser-based interactions.

-   Mobile We put together visuals in a short amount of time. It makes
    sense that we would borrow from a design library. We did not go with
    iOS. We knew our first stab at this design that we would be on the
    phone. The decision to use Figma's port of Material Design boxed us in
    a bit. It gave us time, however, to benefit us moving forward on the
    design quickly.
    
    **\* Research
    \*\*** Other task apps

Much work has been done for us already if we only look and see what is
out there. To keep us from doing repetitive work, looked at commonly
used (but established) features that we would use as pieces of our
puzzle in building the initial prototypes.

**Common traits** The commonality is an IRL system of gathering groceries
in our case.

-   **Task Rabbit**
-   **Amazon (Wholefoods)**
-   **Instacart**

Our analysis required we break the information down into simliar
components

-   Cart
-   Schedule
-   Sort

### Zeroing in on trust

**Themes that include trust**

### Looking at the Task Business

As the dev team went to design an inital user model in the code, the UX
Team went to take a mental snapshot of where mental boundaries may help
guide our priorities. We might need to express them at design handoff.  
**Business Analysis** While it may be fun to have a ‘karma'-like
affordance to energize task uptake&#x2026;we do find some priorities:

-   Cart
-   Date
-   Items
-   Sort

**Learn Quick** Our user, we imagine, is a real person with limited time.
Who does she pay back first.

**Closeness of Volunteers and Trust Themes**

A level of trust is required

Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative
persona felt that way, The seams are still closing in on their way to
delivering it to four groups of 10 people.

### But how do you know?

**Persona**

Sabrina works to raise two children.

To maintain growing trust, neighbors in the persona's proximity see
opportunities to help and add them to their queue.


<a id="orgbc4be48"></a>

## Thin air trust

Sabrina needs help. She needs to ask for a favor. The gudeeds app needs
more uptake to be successful. It is my role to ask if something is
possible from the dev team. Don' t we need a network in place to gain
trust? Is that something that can be coded?

The persona add neighbors and they in-turn help her down the line.
Without an initial network, how would confidence translate to favor
completions? The dev team seemed to ponder out input closely.


<a id="orgaa7d328"></a>

### On the Problem

**Just the stress of asking is enough of a barrier to moving forward.**


<a id="org7ae4649"></a>

### For the Solution

**Less Stressed**

Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve
or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems
appropriate.

While she may be busy, she is less stressed out on this one instance.

## Design work


<a id="orged08391"></a>

### Sketching

-   [design Studio Brackets]

**Designing for the Time Crunch** A situation recognized as a
'time-crunch.'


<a id="org3cf7f2d"></a>

### Two canvases

There is the volunteer who participates by completing grocery pickup,
and other tasks for neighbor. Do we build first for the volunteer, or
the neighbor?

**Discussing them separately**

Are we talking about the same screen? The actual meeting we had on this
was short but valuable. The design and engineering agreed that everyone
would start at the same page one.

We are trying to make sure that an extremely busy person is not spending
more time learning how to use our app at the end the week. Sabrina, for
example, may have the app in hand to possibly do the opposite, and take
on more tasks than usual. We now had our one-pager - a few screens laid
out in succession. This is when we put that much to the test.

**moving slightly into color**

**Getting answers with the help of two actual people**


<a id="org5f86738"></a>

### Clear feedback

We easily save time by acting on the right feedback, and make good bets
on where they are taking us by acting on their clues

**Our initial perception** She prepares for her upcoming week with the
help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

**Our perception of obvious placement of a primary button, was
actuallly:**

-   Confusing
-   Redundant

**Categories** Clarifying types of tasks that others get help with, she is
likely to book also.


<a id="org9076172"></a>

## Right now


<a id="org1fb3e51"></a>

### Gudeeds as client

To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation implies that
their app is better at being reliable.


<a id="org8189384"></a>

### Next Steps

**Explore if gamification is a good fit.**

Sandra just downloaded the Gudeeds app. The app will help build trust
across her neighbors ' relationships.

If booking now is based on trust, will charts and mini-analyticst be
more efficient to confirming her bookings?
