#### First meeting between the devs and the design team



If there was a Sandra 2, Talisa.  If Talisa sees the types of tasks that others get help with, she is likely to book also.  Categorization was done from research, and analysis facilitated this.  Talisa books now based on trust.  If charts and mini-analytics were available to her, she might be more efficient at her bookings. 

At the end of her weeks, she sees your life caseload with two children diminish while continueing to schedule more help and address her upcoming week.  In all, while maybe still busy, she is less stressed out.

#### Presentation

Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative persona felt that way,The seams are still closing in on their way to delivering it to four groups of 10 people.
