### Platforms
[-] Webapp
[-] Mobile

### Project Summary

To maintain growing trust,  neighbors in the persona's proximity see opportunities to help and add them to their queue.  Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems appropriate.  She prepares for her upcoming week with the help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

### Project

#### First meeting between the devs and the design team

I cannot exhibit control here.  It is a joint meeting and the people are new.  Dinosaurs were mentioned.  I can at least repeat what I like: Dinosours.  Sandra is busy and just downloaded the Gudeeds app.  The app will help build trust across her neighbors relationships.  Sabrina happens to be busy, especially with tasks required to raise 2 children.  To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation means that there app is better at being reliable.  

If there was a Sandra 2, Talisa.  If Talisa sees the types of task that others get help with, she is likely to book also.  Categorization done from research and analysis facilitated this.  Talisa books now based on trust.  If charts and mini-analytics were available to her, she might be more efficient at her bookings. 

At the end of her weeks, she sees your life caseload with two children diminish while continueing to schedule more help and address her upcoming week.  In all, while maybe still busy, she is less stressed out.

#### Presentation

Our persona, Sandra was representative of a situation recognized as a 'time-crunch.' She saw and recognized neighborly deeds as tasks that she figures are better to pay back.  Our UX Team serves this aim by being part of the get-it-done process.  A level of trust is required. Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative persona felt that way, continues into my role as presenter.  The seams are still closing in on their way to delivering it to four groups of 10 people.
