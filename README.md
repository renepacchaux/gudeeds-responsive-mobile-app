# Design, Collaboration, and Good deeds

## What are the needs of close neighbors?

**Codeable baseline** What can we (as a group) get done that is out of
realm of possibility. Not for lack of skill, but for time and money.
Here, I take my chance to ask any questions about project dream vs
reality.

**Platforms** We called out our assumptions first. Pulling out a laptop at
a grocery store: certain. Pulling out a phone: yes.

-   Webapp Our work can work for iOS devices, but up to a point. We
    focused on browser based interactions.

-   Mobile This desicion affected which design library we would implement
    for our prototype in short order.
    
    **\* Research
    \*\*** Other Task Apps

To keep us from reinventing certain wheels, we make sure we looked at
what was established en masse for simliar apps. **Business Analysis** The
commonality is an IRL system of gathering (groceries) in our case.

-   **Task Rabbit**
-   **Amazon (Wholefoods)**
-   **Instacart**

Our analysis required we break the information down into simliar
components

-   Cart
-   Schedule
-   Sort

As we moved towards defining user needs, the image of a milk jug as
emblematic of ‘in what space' we were trying to accomplish our design

### Zeroing in on trust

**Themes that include trust**

![img](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_939A39C54BE532AA128503EB46A60918FB25F0AE543B578BF78BB58E8F771B97_1626047441287_2021-07-11+18.47.58.gif)

### Looking at the Task Business

As the dev team went to design an inital user model in the code, the UX
Team went to take a mental snapshot of where mental boundaries may help
guide our priorities. We might need to express them at design handoff.  
**Business Analysis** While it may be fun to have a ‘karma'-like
affordance to energize task uptake&#x2026;we do find some priorities:

-   Cart
-   Date
-   Items
-   Sort

**Learn Quick** Our user, we imagine, is a real person with limited time.
Who does she pay back first.

**Closeness of Volunteers and Trust Themes**

A level of trust is required

Our team, in starting to figure out and document why our representative
persona felt that way, The seams are still closing in on their way to
delivering it to four groups of 10 people.

### But how do you know?

**Persona**

Sabrina happens to be busy, especially with tasks required to raise two
children.

To maintain growing trust, neighbors in the persona's proximity see
opportunities to help and add them to their queue.

## Syncing Up


<a id="orgd87e5e8"></a>

### On the Problem

**Just the stress of asking is enough of a barrier to moving forward.**


<a id="org7a379ed"></a>

### For the Solution

**Less Stressed**

Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve
or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems
appropriate.

while maybe still busy, she is less stressed out.

## The Design Work


<a id="org47543b5"></a>

### Sketching

-   [design Studio Brackets]

**Designing for the Time Crunch** A situation recognized as a
'time-crunch.'


<a id="org227007d"></a>

### Wireframes

**Discussing user A, user B**

At the end of her weeks, she sees your life caseload with two children
diminish while continueing to schedule more help and address her
upcoming week.

**moving up fi, finding user A, user B.**


<a id="org8786e07"></a>

### What testing taught us

**Our initial perception** She prepares for her upcoming week with the
help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

**Our perception of obvious placement of a primary button, was
actuallly:**

-   Confusing
-   Redundant

**Categories** Clarifying types of tasks that others get help with, she is
likely to book also.

## Current Status


<a id="org508cc3f"></a>

### Gudeeds as client

To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation implies that
their app is better at being reliable.


<a id="org6eaea12"></a>

### Next Steps

**Explore if gamification is a good fit.**

Sandra is busy and just downloaded the Gudeeds app. The app will help
build trust across her neighbors ' relationships.

If booking now is based on trust, will charts and mini-analyticst be
more efficient to confirming her bookings?
