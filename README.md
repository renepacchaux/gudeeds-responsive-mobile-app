### Intro

I practice meeting with developers. Those meetings had to be short and decisive.

Part of a team of 4 designers and 5 developers, carrying out design decisions meant meeting with the design team more often to agree on touchpoints. I communicated the design process to show progress when meeting with engineers.

**Devices in mind**

At this initial stage, I need to describe a thing that already works. For an example scenario, I picture myself at a grocery store. I am carrying a laptop. Who pulls out a laptop at the grocery store? I am likely to instead use my phone. Before any pencil has hit paper, I have made a mental decision about where this application will live.

To help move this piece forward, I can set one screen as a goal: the mobile version. The mobile-sized screen is my chosen screen to build upon. This would put anything other than phone-sized screens further down the priority ladder.

I call out a few details about the choices and what doors they might open for future continued updates.

-   Desktop Web Application
    
    I can get a lot out of browsers. This situations where a user will open a laptop or be at a desktop are already defined to me, in a sense.

-   Mobile
    
    I know there is less room for features. Where a user looks first takes a smaller footprint.

To help, I took pieces from [Figma's Material Design UI kit] (<https://www.figma.com/community/file/880534892514982400>) It goes a bit beyond just designing for iOS products.

I described my pre-conceptions when meeting with the other designers. When I talk to the design team, I might mention apps being built out for multiple screens.

I reap the benefit of not doubling my effort over the same material. I need to know consensus direction but not plans. I can listen to issues about the buildout along the way. I wanted to commit to the next meeting being a smooth one.

## Research

Much work has been done for us already if we only look and see what is out there. To keep from doing repetitive work, we looked at commonly used (but widely established) features that we would use as pieces of our puzzle in building the initial prototypes.

**Common traits**

In similar task app we find categories or filters and there is at least someone picking up groceries for somebody else.

-   Task Rabbit
-   Amazon (Wholefoods)
-   Instacart

I work to break feature information down into digestible parts. This gives me an opportunity to investigate work that has been created before over adding new capabilities in an unleashed way.

-   Cart
-   Schedule
-   Sort

I involve more and more interviewees, testers, co-workers, and actual neighbors get get a better grasp of what the user might use.

### Zeroing in on trust

There is no clear way to get a social network started from scratch.

**Trust themes**

We grouped the themes that came up among our own neighbors.

### Looking at the Task Business

In the inner workings of Gudeeds, the design contributed to what is seen by the user, that qualifies as the point of entry as a person who needs a thing. I am concerned about efficiency and where time spent simply learning to use the app guides our priorities.

The cross-functional team went to build all the parts that make up a virtual person within an app. They are a person has age and location, as task giver or receiver.

Ultimately, I am building context to hand off and accurately express the blueprints to the team that will build it.

**Business Analysis**

These allow the user to work fast:

-   Cart
-   Date
-   Items
-   Sort

There are symbols or items people expect and go to first.

**Learn Quick**

In a persona, I attempt to sketch out the day-to-day of a real person with limited time as it pertains to specific frustrations. Who does she pay back first?

**Closeness of Volunteers and Trust Themes**

**First to sign up**

I sketch out the mental picture to figure out and document why a person in Sabrina's shoes would have felt the way she did.

I thought about delivery and the final designer meeting. I was a little nervous delivering it forty people.


<a id="org177f3bf"></a>

### But how do you know?

Our persona was built on a few back-and-forths we had about our mindset.

She has kids and little time. Our Sabrina happens to be a nurse with odd hours.

I take my chance to ask any questions about our representative person, Sabrina.

**Persona 1**

Sabrina also works to raise two children.

To maintain a growing connection to the people around her and in her building, neighbors need opportunities to help. I worked on a way to simplify this.


<a id="orgdab606a"></a>

### Trust Summary

Sabrina needs help. She needs to ask for a favor. The gudeeds app needs more uptake to be successful.

It is my role to ask what is possible from the dev team.

Don't we need a network in place to gain trust? Is that something that can be coded? The team of engineers seemed to appreciate this problem being voiced at our meeting. Do we make it fun like a game, or do we consider putting it in the ‘maybe pile' for now?

The persona adds neighbors. They, in turn, help *her* down the line. Without an initial network, what would lead Sabrina to believe that this app can be of any help when she downloads it?


<a id="org60b9257"></a>

### On the Problem

I needed to sketch and visualize it.

Frustrating, but expected. That is what we are banking on. A solid direction for the app. The difference between *saying it* and *doing it*.

Just the stress of asking is enough of a barrier to moving forward.


<a id="org14569ec"></a>

### For the Solution

**Less Stressed**

While she may be busy, the estimation is that at this particular moment, she is less stressed out.

Their offers of help go to Sabrina, where if she wants, she can approve or deny based on her original request, focusing on neighbors she deems appropriate.

## Design


<a id="orgc04c2c8"></a>

### Sketching

I contributed to the design studio visuals knowing we had a short amount of time. We used a bracket system to come up with the final design for our sprint. I knew my first pencil design would be on a phone width canvas, or a 3x5 actual physical card. I moved forward incrementally, and so did the design team. It gave us time as it guaranteed forward action on a design decision.

**Designing for the Time Crunch**

A situation was a time-crunch. It was a competition with judgement at the end.


<a id="org3aeebb0"></a>

### Two canvases

There is the volunteer who participates by completing grocery pickup and other tasks for the neighbors. I had to be sensitive to who to build with first - the volunteer or the neighbor, or both?

**Discussing them separately**

I work to make sure an extremely busy person is not inundated with learning how to use our app at the end of the week. Sabrina, for example, may have the app in hand to possibly do the opposite and take on more tasks than usual.

Now there is a one-pager. In total, a few screens laid out in succession. This is when we put that much to the test.

Are we talking about the same screen? It may be both. Meeting on this topic was short but valuable. The design and engineering teams agreed that it would be both.

**Moving to color**

Our design library helped make this decision for us.

**2 Neighors**

We asked actual neighbors for their help.


<a id="orga372280"></a>

### Clear feedback

We easily save time by acting on good feedback and making good bets. They lead us when acting on their clues.

**Our initial perception**

Sabrina hypothetically prepares for her upcoming week with the help of the Gudeeds app volunteer scheduling app.

**Primary action button perception**

-   Confusing
-   Redundant

**Categories**

Clarifying types of tasks that others get help with, she is likely to book also.


<a id="org07002eb"></a>

### Moving forward

Gamification can be useful here and something worthy of testing out. I decided to explore this.

It would be fun to have a ‘karma'-like score. Maybe for the backend - a dashboard, maybe. Because the testing gave an already clear direction, this contribution did not make it past the design studio stage at the early stages of work.

At judgment time, I thought back to the positive approach ‘more' hierarchy would add to the app. I might come back around on gamification.

### Gudeeds as client

To Gudeeds, the tasks mean bookings. Each confirmation implies that their app is better at being reliable.


<a id="orgd8bde05"></a>

### Next Steps

Turning the task system into a gam sounds like a fun idea.

**Fit for games**

Sandra just downloaded the Gudeeds app. The app will help build trust across her neighbors ' relationships.

If booking now is based on trust, will charts and mini-analytics be more efficient to confirming her bookings?
